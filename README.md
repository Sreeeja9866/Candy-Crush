# 🍬 Candy Crush Clone

A fun and interactive web-based **Candy Crush** style game built with pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project demonstrates key concepts in drag-and-drop functionality, grid-based logic, and game loop implementation — ideal for beginner to intermediate JavaScript learners.

---

## 🎮 Game Features

- 🧩 Match-3 gameplay logic (both row and column crushing)
- 🔁 Continuous game loop to check, crush, slide, and generate candies
- 🖱️ Drag and drop functionality to swap candies
- 📊 Live score updates as you play
- 🎨 Fully responsive 9x9 game board with themed visuals

## 🧠 JavaScript Concepts Covered

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| DOM Manipulation | Dynamic tile creation and updates |
| Event Handling | Drag-and-drop events (`dragstart`, `drop`, etc.) |
| Intervals | Game loop using `setInterval` to refresh board state |
| Conditionals & Loops | Checking matches, validating swaps, scoring |
| Array Management | Grid structure using 2D arrays |
| Functions | Modular logic separation (`crushCandy`, `slideCandy`, `generateCandy`) |
